## Description

This document describes the requirements for Colly from The Customer and the changes they introduce to Colly.

This is not the full list of attributes for these objects, but only those that will be processed as per The Customer’s requirements.

## Environment

| Colly Attribute                                   | Attribute Type                                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

## To discuss

- [x] `lastIdpLoginDate`
  - Implement as in the old Colly

- [x] `ticketLinks`
  - This is the last deploy ticket ID
  - Not needed

- [x] `type`

  - `type` was previously determined based on labels set by the Cloud Passport Discovery CLI, but this functionality is being removed.
  - We will keep the attribute with the ability for users to set it manually.
  - Open Questions (OQ):
    1. Should this attribute be computed by Colly (and if so, based on what criteria), or should it be user-defined?
       1. It should be user-defined, selected from a predefined list without ability to extend
    2. Does the customer need this type-based environment categorization?
       1. No, it is not required.

- [x] `lastDeployedSDsByType` ??

  - Determines the latest SD of a given type that was successfully deployed to one of the namespaces included in the environment.
  - This attribute is used for CI environments.
  - Shows the scope of the last successful deployment operation.
  - Single field with a complex object:

    ```yaml
    <sd-type>: <SD app:ver>
    ```

    for example

    ```yaml
    product: product-sd:1.2.3
    project: my-project:1.2.3
    ```

  - Mapping of SD type to SD name is specified in the Colly deployment parameters:

    ```yaml
    solutionDescriptors:
      <sd-type>:
        - <sd-name-regexp>
    ```

  - Default value:

    ```yaml
    solutionDescriptors:
      product:
        - (?i)product
      project:
        - (?i)project
    ```

- [x] `deploymentOperations`
  - This attribute contains information obtained from the configMap `sd_versions`.
  - This attribute is temporary. In the future, the information source for deployment operations will be replaced by a dedicated service, which will require a change in the parameter model.
  - DD deployment is out of scope.

- [x] `status`
  - Propose ![env-state-machine.drawio.png](/docs/images/env-state-machine.drawio.png)
    1. `PLANNED` Planned for deployment, but not yet deployed. It exists only as a record in Colly for planning purposes.
    2. `FREE` The Environment is successfully deployed in the cloud but is not used by anyone; it is ready for use and not scheduled for usage.
    3. `IN_USE` The Environment is successfully deployed in the cloud and is being used by a specific team for specific purposes.
    4. `RESERVED` The Environment is successfully deployed in the cloud and reserved for use by a specific team, but is not currently in use.
    5. `DEPRECATED` The Environment is not used by anyone, and a decision has been made to delete it.
  - OQ:
    1. What are the cases?
    2. Should it be extendable?
       1. NO
    3. What is `to be deprecated`? Why do we not have `deprecated`, `deleted`, or `not used` states?
    4. Do we need `MIGRATING` (meaning the upgrade is in progress)?

- [x] `clusterInfoUpdateInterval`, `clusterInfoUpdateStatus.lastSuccessAt`
    1. What are the main scenarios?
       1. The user wants to check that the cluster status shown in Colly is up to date and matches the real state of the cluster, so they can make decisions.
          1. Solution:
             1. Cluster attribute `clusterInfoUpdateStatus.lastSuccessAt` shows the time of the last successful sync
             2. Colly instance (operational service) attribute `clusterInfoUpdateInterval` shows the sync frequency
       2. The user thinks the cluster status data is outdated and wants to trigger a sync manually.
          1. Solution: We do NOT allow users to trigger the sync manually.
       3. An external system integrated with Colly thinks the data is outdated and wants to trigger sync.
          1. Solution: Use the API `/colly/v2/inventory-service/manual-sync`
    2. Should Colly support a forced `clusterInfoUpdate`, not by schedule but by user request?
       1. The customer will call this API as part of their workflow, but users in the UI will not have access to this.
    3. What is the recommended sync frequency with the cluster?
       1. At least once every 30 minutes.

- [x] `role`

  - Should it be extendable?
    - Currently, `role` values are extended via deployment parameters
  - A separate interface to provide the list of roles is needed
  - Challenge the predefined list of roles
    - [`Dev`, `QA`, `Project CI`, ~~`SaaS`~~, `Joint CI`, ~~`Other`~~, `Pre Sale`] - set via deployment parameters

- [x] `team` or `teams`? `owner` or `owners`?
  - `owners`, `teams` are lists

- [x] Each POST in the API will result in a separate commit

- [x] `id` is `uuid`; `name` is `<environment-name>`

- [x] The mediation layer composes the API between the inventory and operational services

- [x] It should be possible to get a list of projects
  - `/colly/v2/inventory-service/projects`
    - returns a summary view:
      - projectId
      - projectName
  - `/colly/v2/inventory-service/projects/Id`
    - returns detail view
    - The potential problem of a project with two instance repositories will be addressed when it arises

- [x] It should be possible to get a list of clusters
  - `/colly/v2/inventory-service/clusters`
    - returns a summary view:
      - clusterId
      - projectName
  - `/colly/v2/inventory-service/projects/Id`
    - returns detail view

- [x] Add the `deployPostfix` attribute to the Namespace?
  - No

- [x] Is it correct to say that a single physical business solution instance, consisting of product and project applications, can be modeled with two EnvGene environments - one for product, one for project?
  - No, there is only one Environment.

- [x] Before creating a cluster, the environment queries Colly to check if there is already a cluster with the same name.

- [x] If Colly discovers the instance repo and receives a cluster that already exists in Colly (by the `name` attribute), another one is created with the same name but a unique ID.

- [ ] What should be the scope of synchronization between Colly and the cluster
  1. All clusters of the instance
  2. Individual clusters
  3. Individual environments within a cluster

- [ ] Lock
  - The lock must answer the following questions:
    - Status: locked or not locked
    - Who locked it: free-form string
    - Reason for locking: free-form string
    - When it was locked: timestamp
    - When it will be unlocked: date
  - Required interfaces:
    - Set/remove lock on the environment
    - Force sync lock status from Git (can be implemented later)
  - Only a Colly admin can lock through the UI; users cannot
  - OQ:
    1. Should locks be defined by inventory backend?
    2. Who, when and why lock/unlock
    3. What are the cases from SSP?

- [ ] What does the TheCustomer -> Colly -> EnvGene integration look like when creating an Environment?

- [ ] How to aggregate DeploymentOperations across the namespaces of the environment?

- [ ] The SaaS instance of Colly must support:
  - How do we roll out a new version of Colly (canary deployment)?
  - The mediation layer finds Colly via service mesh

- [ ] It should be possible to get a list of environments per project
  - Implement by adding a search by `projectId` parameter to `/colly/v2/inventory-service/environments`
    - It is necessary to introduce the `projectId` attribute to the environment object
  - The Customer does NOT require information about which `customerName` an environment belongs to, nor obtaining lists of environments by `customerName`

- [ ] Add "default values" to Project attributes, for example:
  - `app:ver` of the env template artifact
  - Template name in the artifact
  - Short term:
    - Defaults are set manually in Git + Colly returns them as a project attribute
  - Long term:
    - ability to set them via API appears
  - "Default values" are optional for the project
  - There should be an ability to set "default values" at the global level.
    - Who merges global into project?:
      - Colly?
      - Who else (fast click)?
  - OQ:
    - Do you need templateDescriptorNames or defaultTemplateDescriptorName? or both?

- [ ] Environment groups
  - `accessGroups`
    - List of groups that can work with the project => used for access control in SSP:
      - Who can see/edit which env
    - Attribute in env inventory
    - There should be an ability to set this attribute:
      - When creating env (`env_inventory_generation`)
  - `effectiveAccessGroups`
    - Resolved full list of groups (contains groups and their descendants)
    - Attribute in env inventory
    - Need to display the resolved list at the time of env creation => need to save it somewhere
    - OQ:
      - Who computes `effectiveAccessGroups`
        - not Colly
      - Where is the `effectiveAccessGroups` cache stored
        - in Git
      - Only read or also write `effectiveAccessGroups` and `accessGroups` via Colly?

- [ ] Is information about synchronization with git repositories (inventory service) needed:

    ```yaml
    # colly operational service
    projectGitInfoUpdateStatus.lastSuccessAt:
    # cluster
    clusterInfoUpdateStatus.lastSuccessAt:
    # env
    gitInfoUpdateStatus.lastSuccessAt:
    ```

- [x] deploymentOperations

  1. How do we determine CLEAN_INSTALL (ACHKA does not provide this attribute)?
  2. Rename mode CLEAN_INSTALL -> "??" ROLLING_UPDATE -> "??"

  **solution:** remove deploy mode. In the Argo world there is no CLEAN_INSTALL -> there is only one type of deployment.

- [x] `/colly/inventory-service/v2/projectDefaults`

    This interface returns what is stored in `/defaults/parameters.yaml` in the project Git repo

    ```yaml
    clusters:
      roAdGroups: list of strings
      rwAdGroups: list of strings
      owners: list of strings
    ```

- [x] `MAVEN_REPO_NAME`

  - **Add `mavenRepoName` attribute to Project**
  - Do we need MAVEN_REPO_URL? If yes, is it one per project?
  - Proposal: put parameters required for passport under a single flexible map

  ```text
  MAVEN_REPO_URL: https://artifactorycn.netcracker.com/ -> not needed for now
  MAVEN_REPO_NAME: pd.saas-global.mvn.group
  ```

- [ ] `templateDescriptorNames` discovery from artifact.
  - Add a Colly interface that takes app:ver, uses app/reg defaults, downloads the artifact, processes the content, and returns the list of templates in the artifact
  - Put in backlog, pick up later

- [ ] What is revert of UI paramsets? Removal of all overrides for env or env+ns+app?

- [ ] The user must clearly understand why a Colly attribute value is empty - whether it was not discovered, or is simply empty

- [ ] If during sync with instance repo:
    1. no `/environments/<cluster>/<env>/Inventory/env_definition.yaml|yml` => delete the env
    2. `/environments/<cluster>/<env>/Inventory/env_definition.yaml|yml` exists + env is in cache + "validations" failed:
       1. valid yaml
       2. valid against Colly schema
       3. ~~ui paramset association exists, but no paramset~~
         => update `lastSuccessfulSyncAt` status
    3. `/environments/<cluster>/<env>/Inventory/env_definition.yaml|yml` exists + env is not in cache + "validations" failed:
       1. valid yaml
       2. valid against Colly schema
       3. ~~ui paramset association exists, but no paramset~~
         => env is created with the fields that can be read

- [ ] if one paramset failed to save, all paramsets will not be saved

- [ ] what is the SSP role model, how does it affect Colly (who changes the owner on env, who changes ui paramsets, ...). Integration via shared idp? How is this related to `effectiveAccessGroups`
  - перейти на общий idp

- [ ] `region` on cluster
  - `region` - новый аттрибут опциональный, который забирается из клауд паспорта
  - RO аттрибут
  - удалить с энва

- [ ] ES
  - [ ] нужен ли `ui_override_committed` стейт параметра
  - [ ] отображать ли ES для энва или нс (без аппа)
    - [ ] отображать деплой и рантайм контекст нужно только для нс + апп
    - [ ] отображать пайплайн контекст нужно для всего энва

- [ ] PS
  - [x] если один из парамсетов не может быть создан, ддругие в запросе тоже не создаются
  - [ ] у pipeline контекста только энв уровень (нельзя привязать к нс или аппу)

- [x] cmApproach

    1. При создание энв деф, SSP дополнительно передает:

          ```yaml
          metadata:
            cmApproach: enum[cmdb, noCmdb] # Optional
          ```

    2. В Колли энве появляется новый аттрибут `cmApproach`, который читается из env_definition `metadata.cmApproach`. # Default - Null/Unknown
       1. Через API должна быть возможность изменить значение

    3. В Колли проекте у репозитория с типом `envgeneInstance` появляется новый аттрибут `defaultCmApproach`. Этот аттрибут используется SSP для того что бы не заставлять пользователя задавать `cmApproach` при создание каждого энва. Этот аттрибут задается пользователем только вручную в гите

    4. AI: Найти правильное место для cmdb url/login/token для конкретного энва. В ES?
       1. ES генерируется и при `cmdb` подходе
       2. Делаем отдельно от 1-3

- [ ] Colly-to-Prod
  1. выдаем версию с этим функционалом
  2. SSP тестирует
  3. эта версия Колли устанавливается на прод
